          content: `## Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

Acute coronary syndrome is a spectrum of conditions caused by sudden reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. It includes ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina.

## How it presents

The classic presentation is central, crushing chest pain that may radiate to the jaw or left arm, with sweating, nausea and breathlessness. Important exceptions are people with diabetes and older patients, who may have a "silent" or atypical presentation such as breathlessness or collapse without much pain.

## Distinguishing the three

| Feature | Unstable angina | NSTEMI | STEMI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Troponin | Normal | Raised | Raised |
| ST elevation | No | No | Yes |
| Mechanism | Partial occlusion | Partial occlusion with necrosis | Complete occlusion |

## Investigations

- A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the first investigation. ST elevation or a new left bundle branch block points to a STEMI.
- Serial troponin (a cardiac muscle protein) distinguishes NSTEMI from unstable angina.

## Immediate management

The memory aid is often given as morphine, oxygen, nitrates and aspirin, but oxygen should only be given if oxygen saturations are low.

- **STEMI**: offer primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if it can be delivered within 120 minutes; otherwise thrombolysis.
- **NSTEMI**: give dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation, then risk-stratify with the GRACE score to decide on the timing of angiography.

> Secondary prevention after any ACS is the combination often summarised as: aspirin, a second antiplatelet, a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor and a statin, plus cardiac rehabilitation.`,

          content: `## Atrial fibrillation (AF)

Atrial fibrillation is the commonest sustained heart rhythm disturbance. The atria contract in a disorganised way, producing an irregularly irregular pulse.

## Two problems to solve

Managing AF means addressing two separate questions: rate or rhythm, and stroke risk.

### Rate versus rhythm control

- **Rate control** is first line for most people. A beta-blocker (such as bisoprolol) or a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker (such as diltiazem) is used. Digoxin is reserved for sedentary patients.
- **Rhythm control** is preferred when AF has a reversible cause, is of new onset (under 48 hours), causes heart failure, or remains symptomatic despite rate control.

### Stroke prevention

Anticoagulation decisions use the **CHA₂DS₂-VASc** score to estimate stroke risk, balanced against bleeding risk (for example the ORBIT score). A direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is first line; warfarin is reserved for specific situations such as a mechanical heart valve.

> Aspirin is no longer recommended for stroke prevention in AF.`,

          content: `## Chronic heart failure

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome in which the heart cannot maintain enough output for the body's needs. It is commonly divided by the ejection fraction into heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

## Recognising it

Symptoms include breathlessness, orthopnoea (breathlessness lying flat) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (waking breathless at night). Signs include a raised jugular venous pressure, bibasal crackles and peripheral oedema.

## Investigations

- Measure **N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)**. A high level prompts an urgent echocardiogram.
- An echocardiogram assesses the ejection fraction and the underlying cause.

## Management of reduced ejection fraction

First-line drug treatment combines an ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin receptor blocker) with a beta-blocker, titrated up as tolerated. A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is added if symptoms persist, and a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor now has an established role. Loop diuretics such as furosemide relieve congestion but do not improve survival.`,

Both cause an obstructive pattern on spirometry, but they differ in reversibility and the typical patient.

|---|---|---|
| Typical onset | Childhood/young adult | Over 35, smoker |
| Variability | Diurnal, trigger-related | Persistent, progressive |
| Reversibility | Significant with bronchodilator | Limited |
| Atopy | Common | Less relevant |

## Asthma management

Treatment is stepwise. Current guidance favours an inhaled corticosteroid combined with a long-acting beta agonist used both as maintenance and reliever therapy (the MART regimen). Always check inhaler technique and adherence before escalating.

## COPD management

The foundations are stopping smoking, vaccination and pulmonary rehabilitation. Inhaled therapy starts with a short-acting bronchodilator, then a long-acting beta agonist with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. An inhaled corticosteroid is added when there are asthmatic or steroid-responsive features.`,

Pneumonia is infection of the lung parenchyma. It presents with fever, a productive cough, pleuritic chest pain and focal chest signs such as crackles or bronchial breathing.

## Assessing severity: CURB-65

Each feature scores one point:

- **C**onfusion (new disorientation)
- **U**rea greater than 7 mmol/L
- **R**espiratory rate of 30 or more per minute
- **B**lood pressure low (systolic under 90 or diastolic 60 or less)
- Age **65** or over

A score of 0 to 1 suggests home treatment may be appropriate, 2 suggests considering hospital, and 3 or more suggests severe pneumonia.

## Treatment

Antibiotic choice follows severity and local guidelines: amoxicillin for low-severity disease, with a macrolide added or a broader agent used as severity rises. Always safety-net and arrange follow-up.`,

Diabetes is a group of conditions causing persistent hyperglycaemia. The two common forms differ in mechanism.

| Feature | Type 1 | Type 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanism | Autoimmune beta-cell destruction | Insulin resistance and relative deficiency |
| Typical onset | Younger, lean | Older, often overweight |
| Ketosis-prone | Yes | No (usually) |
| First-line treatment | Insulin | Lifestyle then metformin |

## Diagnosis

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 48 mmol/mol or more is diagnostic, or a fasting glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or more. In someone with symptoms a single abnormal result is enough; without symptoms it should be repeated.

## Type 2 treatment escalation

Start with lifestyle change, then metformin. A sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor is added or chosen early when there is established cardiovascular disease, heart failure or chronic kidney disease. Targets are individualised, with particular care to avoid hypoglycaemia in frail or older people.

## Complications to screen for

Diabetes damages small and large vessels. Annual review covers the eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (urine albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate), feet (neuropathy and circulation) and cardiovascular risk.`,

|---|---|---|---|
| Hypothyroid | High | Low | Primary hypothyroidism |
| Hyperthyroid | Low | High | Primary hyperthyroidism |
| Subclinical hypothyroid | High | Normal | Monitor; treat by symptoms/level |

## Hypothyroidism

The picture is one of a slowed metabolism: fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation and dry skin. The commonest cause is autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Treatment is levothyroxine, titrated against the TSH, starting at a low dose in older people or those with heart disease.

## Hyperthyroidism

Features reflect a fast metabolism: weight loss, heat intolerance, tremor and palpitations. Graves disease adds eye signs and a diffuse goitre. A beta-blocker controls symptoms quickly while definitive treatment (carbimazole, radioiodine or surgery) takes effect.`,

Most headaches are benign (tension-type or migraine), but a small number signal serious disease. The skill is sorting one from the other.

## Red flags that warrant urgent action

- **Thunderclap onset** (maximal within seconds to minutes): consider subarachnoid haemorrhage.
- **New headache over 50 with scalp tenderness or jaw claudication**: consider giant cell arteritis and start steroids before the biopsy.
- **Fever, neck stiffness and photophobia**: consider meningitis.
- **Features of raised intracranial pressure**: worse in the morning or on coughing, with vomiting or visual disturbance.
- **Focal neurological signs, reduced consciousness or new seizures.**

## Common primary headaches

| Type | Pattern | Key treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Migraine | Unilateral, throbbing, nausea, photophobia | Triptan plus NSAID; prophylaxis if frequent |
| Tension-type | Bilateral, tight band, no nausea | Simple analgesia, reassurance |
| Cluster | Severe unilateral periorbital, autonomic | High-flow oxygen, subcutaneous triptan |

A stroke is a sudden focal neurological deficit of vascular origin. A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) produces similar symptoms that resolve, and is a warning of high stroke risk.

## Recognition

The public message is FAST: Face, Arm, Speech, Time. Clinically, look for unilateral weakness, speech disturbance, visual field loss and facial droop.

## Immediate management of suspected stroke

- Arrange an **urgent computed tomography (CT) head** to distinguish ischaemic stroke from haemorrhage, because treatment differs completely.
- For ischaemic stroke within the treatment window, offer thrombolysis and consider thrombectomy.
- Once haemorrhage is excluded, give aspirin 300 mg.

## After a TIA

Give aspirin immediately and refer for specialist assessment within 24 hours. Secondary prevention addresses blood pressure, a statin, antiplatelet therapy, atrial fibrillation and carotid disease.`,

Valid consent must be informed, given voluntarily, and made by someone with capacity. In England and Wales the framework is the Mental Capacity Act.

## The five principles

- Capacity is **presumed** in adults.
- People must be **supported** to make their own decision before being judged unable.
- People are allowed to make **unwise** decisions.
- Decisions for those lacking capacity are made in their **best interests**.
- Choose the **least restrictive** option.

## Assessing capacity

Capacity is decision-specific and time-specific. A person has capacity if they can do all four of the following in relation to the specific decision:

- **Understand** the relevant information.
- **Retain** it long enough to decide.
- **Weigh** it up.
- **Communicate** their decision.

> A patient can have capacity for one decision and lack it for another, and capacity can fluctuate, so it is reassessed as needed.

## When capacity is lacking

Act in the person's best interests, taking account of their past wishes, any advance decision and the views of those close to them. A valid advance decision to refuse treatment is legally binding.`,

Keeping patient information private underpins trust. The duty is strong but not absolute.

## When disclosure may be justified

- With the patient's **consent**.
- When **required by law** (for example notifiable diseases, or a court order).
- In the **public interest**, when failure to disclose risks serious harm to the patient or others.

## A worked example: driving

If a patient has a condition that makes them unsafe to drive, advise them that they must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). If they continue to drive against advice and cannot be persuaded to stop, you may breach confidentiality and inform the DVLA, telling the patient before you do so.

Prescribing errors are a common and preventable cause of harm. A systematic approach reduces risk.

## Before you prescribe

- Confirm the **indication** and that the benefit outweighs the risk.
- Check **allergies** and clarify what the reaction actually was.
- Review **interactions** and the patient's renal and liver function.
- Consider **pregnancy and breastfeeding**.

## High-risk drugs worth knowing

| Drug | Key safety point |
|---|---|
| Warfarin | Monitor the international normalised ratio (INR); many interactions |
| Methotrexate | Weekly dosing; never daily; monitor blood counts and liver |
| Lithium | Narrow therapeutic range; monitor levels and renal/thyroid function |
| Insulin | Never omit in type 1 diabetes; prescribe units in full |

## Steroids and the sick-day rule

Long-term corticosteroids suppress the adrenal axis, so they must not be stopped abruptly and the dose should be increased during acute illness. Patients should carry a steroid card.`,

          content: `## Anaphylaxis and allergy

Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening, generalised hypersensitivity reaction. It sits at the extreme end of the allergic spectrum and is a medical emergency.

## Recognising anaphylaxis

Suspect anaphylaxis when there is a sudden-onset illness with **airway, breathing or circulation** problems, usually together with skin or mucosal changes such as widespread hives (urticaria), flushing or swelling (angioedema), after exposure to a likely trigger such as a food, drug or insect sting.

## Immediate management

The single most important treatment is **intramuscular (IM) adrenaline** into the anterolateral thigh, repeated after 5 minutes if there is no improvement.

- Remove the trigger if possible and call for help early.
- Lie the patient flat (or let them sit up if breathing is difficult) and raise the legs if they are hypotensive.
- Give high-flow oxygen and a large intravenous fluid bolus for circulatory compromise.
- Antihistamines and corticosteroids are **second line** and must never delay adrenaline.

A raised serum **mast cell tryptase**, ideally taken soon after the reaction and again later, helps confirm the diagnosis. Because a **biphasic reaction** can occur several hours later, patients are observed before discharge.

## After the acute episode

Every patient should be referred to an allergy clinic, supplied with an adrenaline auto-injector and trained to use it, and advised on how to avoid the identified trigger.

## The wider allergic spectrum

Allergy is an immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated, type I hypersensitivity reaction. Milder presentations include allergic rhinitis, urticaria and mild food reactions. Diagnosis uses **skin prick testing** or **specific IgE** blood tests, and management is allergen avoidance, antihistamines and, for selected severe cases, allergen immunotherapy (desensitisation).`,

          content: `## Patterns of inheritance

Recognising the mode of inheritance from a family tree (pedigree) lets you estimate the risk to relatives and counsel appropriately. Four patterns cover most of what the assessment tests.

## The four classic patterns

| Pattern | Clues in the pedigree | Offspring risk | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| Autosomal dominant | Affected in every generation, both sexes, an affected parent | 50% (1 in 2) | Huntington's disease, Marfan syndrome, neurofibromatosis |
| Autosomal recessive | Often skips generations, unaffected carrier parents, commoner with consanguinity | 25% (1 in 4) if both parents are carriers | Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, haemochromatosis |
| X-linked recessive | Mainly males affected, no male-to-male transmission, passed through carrier mothers | A carrier mother: half of sons affected, half of daughters carriers | Duchenne muscular dystrophy, haemophilia A |
| Mitochondrial | Passed only from the mother to all of her children | All children of an affected woman | Leber hereditary optic neuropathy |

## Concepts worth knowing

- **Penetrance** is the proportion of people carrying a disease gene who actually show the condition. Reduced penetrance can make an autosomal dominant condition appear to skip a generation.
- **Anticipation** is a condition becoming more severe or appearing earlier in successive generations. It is characteristic of trinucleotide repeat disorders such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, in which the repeat lengthens as it is passed on.
- **Consanguinity** (parents who are blood relatives) raises the chance that both partners carry the same recessive gene, increasing autosomal recessive disease risk.

> A quick first step with any pedigree is to ask two questions: are both sexes affected equally, and does the trait appear in every generation? "Every generation, both sexes" points to autosomal dominant; "skips generations, carriers" points to autosomal recessive; "mostly males, through unaffected mothers" points to X-linked recessive.`,

          id: "chromosomal_disorders",

          content: `## Chromosomal disorders

These arise from a missing, extra or rearranged chromosome rather than a single faulty gene. They are usually diagnosed with a karyotype (a picture of the full chromosome set) or with newer molecular tests.

## The common aneuploidies

| Condition | Karyotype | Key features |
|---|---|---|
| Down syndrome | Trisomy 21 | Hypotonia, flat facial profile, single palmar crease, learning disability, congenital heart disease |
| Edwards syndrome | Trisomy 18 | Low birthweight, clenched hands with overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet; high mortality |
| Patau syndrome | Trisomy 13 | Cleft lip and palate, polydactyly, holoprosencephaly; high mortality |
| Turner syndrome | 45,X | Short stature, webbed neck, primary amenorrhoea, coarctation of the aorta; intelligence usually normal |
| Klinefelter syndrome | 47,XXY | Tall stature, small firm testes, gynaecomastia, infertility |

## Antenatal screening for Down syndrome

Screening estimates risk; it does not diagnose. The **combined test** (11 to 14 weeks) uses the nuchal translucency on ultrasound together with two blood markers, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). After 14 weeks the **quadruple test** uses four blood markers instead.

A higher-chance screening result is followed either by **non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT)**, which analyses cell-free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the mother's blood, or by a **diagnostic** test — chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis — which gives a definitive karyotype but carries a small miscarriage risk.

          content: `## Genetic counselling and testing

Genetic counselling helps a person understand and adapt to the medical and psychological implications of an inherited condition. A central principle is that it is **non-directive**: the clinician provides information and support but does not tell the person what to decide.

## Types of genetic test

- **Diagnostic testing** confirms or excludes a condition in someone who already has symptoms.
- **Predictive (presymptomatic) testing** is offered to a healthy person with a relevant family history, for example testing for the Huntington's disease gene. Because the result can be life-changing and there may be no preventive treatment, it is done only with careful counselling before and after the test.
- **Carrier testing** identifies healthy people who carry one copy of a recessive gene and could pass it on, which matters when planning a family.

## Reproductive options

For a couple at risk of passing on a serious condition, options include prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) and **preimplantation genetic testing**, in which embryos created by in vitro fertilisation (IVF) are tested before one is transferred to the womb.

## Consent and confidentiality

Testing a child for an adult-onset condition is generally deferred until the child is old enough to decide for themselves. A genetic result also has implications for relatives, which can create tension between the individual's confidentiality and a family member's interest in knowing their own risk. These situations are handled sensitively and, where needed, with specialist genetics input.`,
